      <p>
        Welcome stranger. This gallery is a WIP. It's built with React and
        exists mainly as a space for experimentation and visual collecting.
      </p>

      <p>
        The images shown here are selected based on personal taste. I’m not
        responsible for how they’re interpreted or the context they carry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next up for this project is implementing filtering by tags, a masonry
        layout and eventually, some animation ive imagined.
      </p>

      <p>Please treat this as an open sketchpad, not a finished product.</p>

      <p>Thank you for visiting!</p>
